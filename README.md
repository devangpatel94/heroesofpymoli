# Heroes of Pymoli
## Summary
* Analysis studies a hypothetical fantasy game called "Heroes of Pymoli". The game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience
* The following conclusions can be reached from the analysis:
  * Of the 1163 active players, the vast majority are male (84%). There also exists, a smaller, but notable proportion of female players (14%).
  * Our peak age demographic falls between 20-24 (44.8%) with secondary groups falling between 15-19 (18.60%) and 25-29 (13.4%).
  * Users tend to spend around $4.00.
  * Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm is the most profitable item with a total purchase value of around $50.
  * The 20-24 age group is the largest age demographic and that age group tends to spend among the most per person (third most of all the age demographics). Under 10 years olds and 35-39 year olds tend to spend a little more per person, but they are also substantially smaller groups.
